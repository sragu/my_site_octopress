We are learn languages as progress through our programming career, we hate some; love some. Once a hot language of the day easily becomes enterprise for the next generations.

There could be a several reasons for that:

* Becoming a thing that you very much mocked at once.
* People learn and expect the language to grow with them, but not all languages grows - most stay right there where majority of users want them them to be at - even its harmful. or in other words they stay at the level of users who generate money for the language creator.
* new people have new perspectives, and they see things different 
* some languages stay stale with their initial propaganda, but things change, new problems arise (multi-core). (i.e. there is always a problem, but not the same problem)

As much true that is the new language is never a new idea, it is just the same idea that has been around but executed better with the collective learning from the past.
